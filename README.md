# Crack detection and segmentation for masonry surfaces

This is a fork of the [crack_detection_CNN_masonry repoistory](https://github.com/dimitrisdais/crack_detection_CNN_masonry), which aims to share the code of their research about crack detection/segmentation on masonry surfaces. This fork improves upon the original code through the following:

* Provide a clearer, well-documented codebase which is easier to interpret and use.
* Separation of the input parameters into configuration files, making it significantly easier to run, train and test multiple networks at the same time.
* Remove weird and unnecessary conventions like folder naming.
* Add better generalizability through the use of configuration files and enhanced dataset support. Add support for more segmentation models.
* Dependency cleanup: clearly indicate all dependencies through a `requirements.txt` file and make the framework compatible with modern Tensorflow.

For changes compared to the original repo, please have a look at the [PR descriptions](https://github.com/DavidHidde/CNN-masonry-crack-tasks/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+). The main changes include:

* Focal loss computation now uses the Tensorflow implementation rather than a custom implementation.
* Unet now only uses the segmentation models variant rather than a custom one depending on the use of a backbone. The Unet parameters have also been updated to use transpose layers in the decoder, matching the paper.
* DeepCrack uses a new [implementation](https://github.com/DavidHidde/DeepCrack-Tensorflow).
* Newer package versions, meaning that some things might be slightly different.

Overall, the core functionality is retained but updated to work with modern setups, be more flexible as well as maintainable. Some results might differ from the original paper, but it is clear that the forked repo does not fully represent the original paper due to its broken state and lack of crack classification support.

## Installation

The project makes use of multiple dependencies. To install these, simply run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.  

Like the original repo, some files must currently be copied over from other repos in order for some configurations to work. This repo solves it through Git submodules:

```bash
git submodule init --recursive
```

## Usage

The basic entrypoint of the program is `run_model.py`:

```bash
python3 run_model.py --operation OPERATION
```

where `OPERATION` should indicate the type of operation to perform. The operation types consist of:

* `build`: Build and process the dataset into a training and validation set.
* `train`: Train a network.
* `test`: Generate predictions.
* `visualize`: Visualize the model architecture in a file.

All operations are listed in their respective [directory](operations/implementation).

### Configuration files

Examples: [`example_network_config.yaml`](example_network_config.yaml) and [`example_dataset_config.yaml`](example_dataset_config.yaml)  

Note that many of the configurations options are either strings, numbers or booleans. These speak for themselves. For some settings, only a set of values are possible. These values are listed in [`types.py`](util/types.py). An overview of all settings and their types is provided in the [`configs`](util/config/).
